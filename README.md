Assorted CTF Challenges I've written.

#### What are the flags?
Flags aren't given though, though nothing has been done to obscure them in the case where there is code involved. If you want the flag/solve, shoot me a message.

#### Can I use these?
Totally! Just remember that they have been used in past CTFs and there may be writeups for them. Message me for the flags/solves/documentation. 

#### I solved the thing!
Dope! Post a writeup and shoot me a message!

#### I can't solve the thing!
Lame! Post an issue and I'll give you some hints.
